## Description
This webpage is responsive & having Maze Generator Game. In which you have to fill details according to your requirement and you can generate maze and play it.
I have used below front-end technologies to make this website:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

<p>
The project Maze Generator is game based mini project on HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In which I have used HTML in little amount, CSS for styling and JavaScript for the functionality in Game. Maze Generator has the feature in which user can pass the height, width, path width, wall width, outer width, path color, wall color. According to user requirement the maze will be generated by the help of Java Script DOM Manipulation. So this project we can say a type of mini project on JavaScript. Also by default I have passed the default maze but as per user requirement it can be changed.
